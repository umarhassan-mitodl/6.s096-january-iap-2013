Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week for 4 weeks, 1 hour / session

Labs: 2 sessions / week for 4 weeks, 1 hour / session

Course Description
------------------

This course provides a fast-paced introduction to the C and C++ programming languages. You will learn the required background knowledge, including memory management, pointers, preprocessor macros, object-oriented programming, and how to find bugs when you inevitably use any of those incorrectly. There will be daily assignments and a small-scale individual project.

Software
--------

### Standard Environment

It's most efficient for the staff if everyone uses the same environment:

*   Athena command-line
*   Compiling: gcc, g++
*   Debugging: gdb, valgrind
*   Editing: nano, pico, vim, or emacs

You can mimic that environment on your own computer:

*   **Windows:** All the necessary packages (except valgrind) are available in [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) (gcc-core, gcc-g++, gdb).
*   **OS X:** [Install Xcode from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835), open it, go to Preferences > Downloads > Components and download "Command Line Tools".
*   **Linux:** `sudo apt-get install build-essential` or equivalent.

### IDEs

If you'd like to use a GUI instead (and there are many good reasons to do so), we'll try to help you out, but:

*   Your programs still need to work in the standard environment, so you should test them there.
*   One of our primary debugging tools (valgrind) may not be available in your IDE.

Nevertheless, these IDEs seem to work well:

*   [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) (Windows, Linux, OS X)
*   [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/junosr1) (Windows, Linux, OS X)
*   Visual Studio (Windows)
*   [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) (OS X)
